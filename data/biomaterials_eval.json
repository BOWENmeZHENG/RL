    "paragraph": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a class of chemicals that are generated after the incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen. At moderate levels, ROS function as critical signaling molecules in the modulation of various physiological functions, including inflammatory responses. However, at excessive levels, ROS exert toxic effects and directly oxidize biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, further exacerbating the development of inflammatory responses and causing various inflammatory diseases.",
