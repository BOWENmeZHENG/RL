    "paragraph": "This work demonstrates a dual-functional tunable terahertz metamaterial absorber based on thermally controllable vanadium dioxide (VO2) and electrically tunable graphene. The switchable absorption functions could be obtained in the same metamaterial, which consists of alternating stacked cross-cut graphene disks (CGDs) and VO2 square rings (VSRs) separated by an ultra-thin dielectric film placed on a continuous gold mirror.",

    "paragraph": "The band structure of graphene, together with its superlative transport properties, has long been predicted to be useful in the manufacture of broadband optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors. Our detector combines graphene with metamaterial perfect absorbers with direct illumination from a single-mode fiber. The new sensor thereby offers opportunities for applications in communications and sensing.",
